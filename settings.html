<p>Here is where some setting will go. I have just started this app and it is still in dev. Please let me know any feed back that you have in the forum for this app on the Google Chrome App Store.</p>

<p>I am soon going to be implementing a small amount of customization which will be modifying the background gradient and maybe choosing another font.</p>



<h3>Its free!</h3>
<p>I planning to keep this small app free. If you like what you see and would like to have this application get even better let me know by donating.</p>
